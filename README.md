# Exploring yoopta editor

So far i've been able to ge the editor working with most of its features (still didnt get into media)

ATM I need this to serve Borja a nice editing platform to annotate his requests for our projects.
Since I can't manage to export the content in plain html, I'm probably not using this for the moment being.

**Possible solutions:**
- define a custom parser myself (not sure if I can do this)
- find some render plugin and scrap the html from the page itself
- wait for the official @yoopta/exports module to be released
